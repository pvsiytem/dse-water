### 🤖 How it works:
- The app is centered around a custom **neural network** trained on water access and demographic data based on ASEAN safely managed drinking water.
- Built with **PyTorch**
- Uses **StandardScaler** for numeric features and **OneHotEncoder** for categories

### 🏗️ Model Architecture:
- Input Layer → Linear(64) → ReLU
- Hidden Layers → 32, 16, 8 neurons with ReLU
- Output Layer → Sigmoid activation (predicts % access)

### 📁 Input Features:
- **Year**
- **Population**
- **Water Stress (%)**
- **Country**
- **Area Type**
